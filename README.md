# React Native Practice
## Codecademy React Native Practice: Build a Woofstagram Create Account Form

---

## What Is it?
For this assignment, Codecademy asked me to build a simple form using `<Text>`, `<TextInput>`, `<View>`, and `<ScrollView>` in a React Native Social Media Dog App. I needed to include an input for email, password, pet's name, pet's date of birth, breed, and favorite toy. This is only one static page which simulates what a create account page would look like for a social media app.

## What I Enjoyed
I really enjoyed using expo and the Expo Go app, because all of my changes appeared in real time on my phone. The error messages were clean and concise, and I was able to troubleshoot any issues quickly. It wasn't required, but I added a header and styled the app using strict CSS. It was a quick project and it helped me better understand how different it is to program a mobile app compared to a webpage app. For fun, I included a Date Picker for the birthday and a 'Confirm Password' input in the app.

## How I Would Elaborate
As the purpose of this project was to become more familiar with native programming, I most likely won't return to this specific app. If I did, I would include validation for the email and password. I would include a section for uploading an image of the pet, as well as, including links to other social media pages for the pup. 

## In Conclusion
React Native is a simple way to transition to native programming as I am very familiar with React and building Single Page Applications with React. I look foward to learning more about building native/mobile apps in the future and how it is different from building traditional webpages.
